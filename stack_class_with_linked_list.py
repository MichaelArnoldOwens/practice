Implement a basic stack class using an linked list as the underlying storage. Stacks have two critical methods, push() and pop() to add and remove an item from the stack, respectively. You'll also need a constructor for your class, and for convenience, add a size() method that returns the current size of the stack. All of these methods should run in O(1) time!

Remember, a stack is a last in, first out data structure!

A singly linked list is a simple way to create a stack. The head of the list is the top of the stack.

Example(s)
const stack = new LLStack();
console.log(stack.size()) // 0
stack.push(2);
stack.push(3);
console.log(stack.size()) // 2
console.log(stack.pop()); // 3
console.log(stack.size()) // 1
console.log(stack.pop()); // 2
